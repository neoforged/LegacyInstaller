 * Changes in v1 of the spec:
 * Adds a new value into the processor argument types:
 * {ROOT} the root directory that we are installing to.
 * {INSTALLER} the absolute path to the currently running installer.
 * {MINECRAFT_VERSION} the version number specified in the config.
 * {LIBRARY_DIR} Path to libraries folder. Typically {ROOT}/libraries/ but can be changed in the future.
 * Expands the token replacement for processors to allow in-line replacements. See Util.replaceTokens
